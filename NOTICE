SAFETY MODIFICATIONS:
- ALL orders are automatically forced to be POST_ONLY (maker-only)
- WebSocket heartbeat events are exposed for connection monitoring

CRITICAL: This fork enforces POST_ONLY flag (4096) on ALL orders.
Orders will never cross the spread and will always be maker orders.
This cannot be disabled without modifying the source code.
