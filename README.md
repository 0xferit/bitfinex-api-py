**A safety-enhanced fork of the official Bitfinex Python API that prevents accidental market/taker orders.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: What This Fork Changes

This fork modifies the official Bitfinex Python API to:

1. **Force POST_ONLY flag on ALL orders** - Cannot be disabled
2. **Reject MARKET orders** - Throws clear error message
3. **Expose WebSocket heartbeat events** - Monitor connection health

## Installation

```bash
pip install bitfinex-api-py-postonly
```

## What's Different From Original

### 1. All Orders Are Post-Only (Maker-Only)

```python
from bfxapi import Client

client = Client(api_key="...", api_secret="...")

# POST_ONLY flag (4096) is automatically added
order = client.rest.auth.submit_order(
    type="EXCHANGE LIMIT",
    symbol="tBTCUSD",
    amount=0.01,
    price=50000
    # No flags needed - POST_ONLY is forced
)

# Even if you try flags=0, POST_ONLY is still added
order = client.rest.auth.submit_order(
    type="EXCHANGE LIMIT",
    symbol="tBTCUSD",
    amount=0.01,
    price=50000,
    flags=0  # Still becomes 4096 internally
)
```

### 2. Market Orders Are Rejected

```python
# This will raise ValueError
try:
    order = client.rest.auth.submit_order(
        type="MARKET",  # or "EXCHANGE MARKET"
        symbol="tBTCUSD",
        amount=0.01
    )
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # "Order type 'MARKET' is incompatible with POST_ONLY enforcement"
```

### 3. WebSocket Heartbeat Events

```python
@client.wss.on("heartbeat")
def on_heartbeat(subscription):
    if subscription:
        print(f"Channel {subscription['channel']} is alive")
    else:
        print("Authenticated connection heartbeat")
```

## Use Cases

### ‚úÖ Perfect For

**Market Making Bots**
```python
# All orders guaranteed to be maker orders
async def place_bid_ask():
    # Both orders will be POST_ONLY, earning maker rebates
    await client.rest.auth.submit_order(
        type="EXCHANGE LIMIT",
        symbol="tBTCUSD",
        amount=0.1,
        price=current_bid - spread
    )
```

**Grid Trading**
```python
# Grid orders won't execute immediately during volatility
for level in grid_levels:
    client.rest.auth.submit_order(
        type="EXCHANGE LIMIT",
        symbol="tBTCUSD",
        amount=0.01,
        price=level
        # POST_ONLY prevents crossing spread
    )
```

**DCA Strategies**
```python
# Buy orders only fill when price comes to you
for price in target_prices:
    client.rest.auth.submit_order(
        type="EXCHANGE LIMIT",
        symbol="tBTCUSD",
        amount=0.01,
        price=price
        # Won't market buy during spikes
    )
```

### ‚ùå NOT Suitable For

- Strategies requiring market orders
- Stop-loss implementations
- Immediate execution needs
- Momentum trading

## Technical Implementation

### Enforcement Layers

1. **REST API** (`rest_auth_endpoints.py`)
   - `submit_order()` - Line 106: Validates order type and adds POST_ONLY
   - `update_order()` - Line 146: Adds POST_ONLY

2. **Middleware** (`middleware.py`)
   - Lines 71-77: Catches all order endpoints
   - Validates order type for submissions
   - Includes maintenance notes for new endpoints

3. **WebSocket** (`bfx_websocket_inputs.py`)
   - `submit_order()` - Line 32: Validates and enforces
   - `update_order()` - Line 71: Enforces POST_ONLY

4. **WebSocket Client** (`bfx_websocket_client.py`)
   - Lines 213-220: Final enforcement layer

### Core Safety Function

```python
def enforce_post_only(flags: Optional[int], order_type: Optional[str] = None) -> int:
    """
    Ensure POST_ONLY flag is set, preserving other flags.
    Validates order type compatibility.
    """
    if order_type and 'MARKET' in order_type.upper():
        raise ValueError(
            f"Order type '{order_type}' is incompatible with POST_ONLY enforcement. "
            "POST_ONLY only works with limit-style orders."
        )
    return POST_ONLY | (flags if flags is not None else 0)
```

## Fee Impact

### Monthly Trading: 100 BTC @ $50,000

**Original API:**
- 50% taker orders: -$5,000 in fees
- 50% maker orders: +$2,500 rebate
- **Net: -$2,500/month cost**

**This Fork:**
- 100% maker orders: +$5,000 rebate
- **Net: +$5,000/month earned**

**Difference: $7,500/month saved**

## Comparison With Original

| Feature | Original `bitfinex-api-py` | This Fork |
|---------|---------------------------|-----------|
| **POST_ONLY default** | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes (forced) |
| **Can place market orders** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No (rejected) |
| **Can cross spread** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| **Taker orders possible** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| **Risk of accidental market orders** | ‚ö†Ô∏è High | ‚úÖ Zero |
| **API compatibility** | - | üíØ 100% |
| **Heartbeat events** | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |

### Original API (Manual Safety)
```python
# Must remember POST_ONLY flag (4096)
order = client.rest.auth.submit_order(
    type="EXCHANGE LIMIT",
    symbol="tBTCUSD", 
    amount=0.01,
    price=50000,
    flags=4096  # ‚ö†Ô∏è Easy to forget!
)
```

### This Fork (Automatic Safety)
```python
# POST_ONLY always enforced
order = client.rest.auth.submit_order(
    type="EXCHANGE LIMIT",
    symbol="tBTCUSD",
    amount=0.01,
    price=50000
    # ‚úÖ POST_ONLY added automatically
)
```

## Migration From Original

No code changes needed - it's a drop-in replacement:

```bash
# Uninstall original
pip uninstall bitfinex-api-py

# Install fork
pip install bitfinex-api-py-postonly
```

Your existing code continues to work, just safer.

## Important Notes

- **Funding offers** are NOT affected (no POST_ONLY flag)
- **All order types** must be limit-style (LIMIT, EXCHANGE LIMIT, etc.)
- **Flag preservation**: Other flags (HIDDEN, REDUCE_ONLY) are preserved
- **No bypass**: There is no way to disable POST_ONLY enforcement

## Problems This Package Solves

- **Accidental Market Orders**: Makes market orders impossible (raises ValueError)
- **Crossing the Spread**: POST_ONLY flag prevents immediate taker execution
- **Taker Fees**: All orders are maker-only, eligible for rebates instead of fees
- **Fat Finger Mistakes**: Orders always go to order book first, won't execute at wrong price
